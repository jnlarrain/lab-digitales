2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line78/status_reg[2]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line67/status_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
